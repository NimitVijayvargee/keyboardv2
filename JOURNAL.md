# May 22

Made a schematic of the keyboard and also laid out all the components into the PCB editor. Did research on the parts and components and am preparing for the Bill of Materials.

# May 26

Re-routing the PCB so that I can include a ground plane. Also improved the schematic by flipping LEDs in alternate rows to decrease routing issues.

# May 27 - June 5th

Polishing the PCB. Also added decoupling resistors according to the PCB Spec. Fixed electrical issues and began setting up my QMK environment to work on the firmware.
Compared prices and conducted research on components across manufacturers. Finalized PCBA and component settings in JLCPCB

# June 6th - June 11th

Completed PCB, created KLE layout (for future porting to VIAL) and setup configs for QMK. Also made the Case sketch

# June 12th 

Completed case (extrusion), compared prices and created BOM list. Case is left to export. After this, I will only need to finish setting up the QMK definitions to work with the LEDs and the rotary encoders.
