Made a schematic of the keyboard and also laid out all the components into the PCB editor. Did research on the parts and components and am preparing for the Bill of Materials.

Re-routing the PCB so that I can include a ground plane. Also improved the schematic by flipping LEDs in alternate rows to decrease routing issues.
